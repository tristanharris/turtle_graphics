The turtle graphics viewer consists of two files: turtle_viewer.rb and lib/turtle_view.rb.

To perform a simple test on the viewer, open a terminal window, make the directory containing the viewer the current directory, and execute

   ./turtle_viewer.rb x.rb

where x.rb is a file in the same directory as the viewer and consists of the single line:

self.track = [[[0.0, 0.0], [200.0, 200.0]], [[200.0, 0.0], [0.0, 200.0]]]

The viewer should appear displaying an X in its upper-right quadrant.

To view the default turtle design, execute

   ./turtle_viewer.rb

To run one of the sample turtle programs, execute

   ./turtle_viewer.rb samples/<file>

where <file> is one of

   byzantium.rb
   hilbert.rb
   koch.rb
   mandala.rb
   tree.rb
